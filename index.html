	<p>
	Junk Removal Philadelphia is a locally owned and operated junk removal services provider that strives to make junk pick up and trash hauling simpler and stress-free for you. We have been serving homeowners and businesses in and around the neighborhood for years and we know Philadelphia inside and out. Our goal is to keep the city beautiful and safe, and we believe that it starts with taking care of rubbish removal in the most responsible way.
	
	Our team prioritizes donating the items you no longer need to a charity or recycle them whenever possible. We also follow eco-friendly policies to dispose of the junk collected from your home or commercial establishment properly if donating or recycling them is not a viable option. This way, we make certain that your useless items do not harm the environment in any way. You can also hire us for demolition and debris removal when remodeling your home or office, or for a full cleanout of your construction site.
